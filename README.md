# Revenue Management Dashboard

AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain with multiple five-star locations across India, has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. Recently, due to strategic moves from competitors and less effective management decisions, AtliQ Grands has faced declining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. To address this challenge, the managing director of AtliQ Grands has decided to leverage Business and Data Intelligence as a strategic tool to regain their market position.

Project Overview
AtliQ Grands lacks an in-house data analytics team, so their revenue management team hired a third-party data analytics provider to deliver critical insights from historical data. This dashboard was created to fulfill that purpose, providing data-driven insights and a visual representation of key metrics to support strategic decision-making.

Objective
As a data analyst, I was tasked with:

Creating relevant metrics as outlined in the provided metric list.
Designing a dashboard based on a mock-up provided by AtliQ Grandsâ€™ stakeholders.
Developing additional insights not explicitly defined in the metric list/mock-up, to further aid decision-making.

This project utilized sample data provided by AtliQ Grands. The primary objectives included identifying revenue trends, customer preferences, booking patterns, and other KPIs crucial for strategic planning in the hospitality industry.

## Key Insights and Features
